For general information on contributing to OpenStack, please check out the

It covers all the basics that are common to all OpenStack projects: the accounts
you need, the basics of interacting with our Gerrit review system, how we
communicate as a community, etc.
Below will cover the more project specific information you need to get started
with heat-translator.
